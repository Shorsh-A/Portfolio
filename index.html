    Thousands of protesters gathered in Bologna in northern Italy ahead of a regional vote on January 26. <br/>

    They are part of a "sardines" movement - named for packing many demonstrators into city squares - and <br/> were demonstrating against far-right leader Matteo Salvini.
    
    The group was formed by four strangers in the <br/> city last November to fight Salvini's anti-immigration message.<br/>
    
    Organisers said around 30,000 to 40,000 people turned up but these figures haven't been confirmed by authorities.<br/>
    
    Their posters read "Solidarity, Welcome, Respect, Rights, Inclusion, Non-Violence, Anti-Fascism".<br/>
    
    On Saturday in Maranello, Salvini held a rally with Lega candidate Lucia Borgonzoni.<br/>
    
    Some polls show close margins between Salvini's League party and the current centre-left government whilst <br/> others show the divide is wide favouring Salvini.
    
    The former interior minister hopes to bring down the Five-Star <br/> Movement after it won the largest vote in<br/> national elections two years ago.
